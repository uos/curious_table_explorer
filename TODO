TODO List
~~~~~~~~~

- clearly separate "desk" and "map" frame

- don't use registered view as last_view, but the one actually observed

- switch to PointXYZRGB

- use 2d-overlap for object view->model matching instead of centroid (done by macmason)

- ModelConstructor::addModelView should be protected and should mark models already taken in this TableView

- refined view registration via pcl::registration::LUM

- Object-Identification at different positions

- Robot contour following um Tisch um automatisch Bilder aufzunehmen
